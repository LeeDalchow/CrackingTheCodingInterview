This repo contains my attempts at the algorithm challenges in the book:

Cracking The Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions & Solutions 5th Edition by Gayle Laakmann McDowell

As each Chapter contains a different type of question, I will create a new class for each chapter, and answer each question in a seperate method.
I will write out the question in full in comments before each method so it is clear what challenge is being solved.
Classes and methods for each chapter will be created static so that they can easily be called from a test harness.
